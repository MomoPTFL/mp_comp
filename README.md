# MP_comp
Asset Library of 100+ effects for Blender's compositor. The effects work procedurally and non-destructive as node-groups using existing nodes, so it will work without the requirement of additional add-ons.

## Requirements
![all_effects_v3 0 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f678b916-2e1a-43b2-8a6d-c0f797cfca31)

MP_Comp V.3.0.0 and later require Blender version 5.0 or later.

## Support the project
This project has originally been released on Ko-Fi and Gumroad as pay-what-you-want (0$+).
If you would like to support the development of MP_Comp, you can do a one-off donation on [my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/moportfolio)!

## Installation

For a more visual installation guide, check the official documentation: [https://moportfolio.de/mp_comp/installation-of-mp_comp/](https://moportfolio.de/mp_comp/installation-of-mp_comp/)

  1. Download the latest MP_Comp release .zip-archive.
  2. Create and link a directory for your asset libraries in Blender, if you haven't got one already.
     If you already have a directory for your asset libraries, move on to step 3.

       I. In Blender, open the preferences under Edit > Preferences
       II. Inside the preferences, go into the "File Paths"-panel.
       III. Under "Asset Libraries", click the "+"-icon on the right side and select a folder where you want Blender to look for Asset Libraries.
       IV. After navigating into a directory of your choice, click the blue "Add Asset Library"-button at the bottom of the file explorer.
       V. Open the Hamburger-menu at the bottom-left of the preferences-window and click "Save Preferences"

       (optional) Change the "Import method" to "Append", so you can go inside the node-groups and edit them (per project)

  3. Extract the "MP_Comp_V#.#.#"-folder from the downloaded zip-archive and place it into your asset libraries folder.

## Usage

Hotkey method: In the compositing-editor of Blender, press Shift+A to add new nodes and choose the effects you need from the "MP_Comp V#.#.#"-dropdown.

Visual method (drag-and-drop): Open a compositing-editor and an asset library-editor in Blender and then drag-and-drop the thumbnails of the MP_Comp-effects into the compositor.
